# Single cycle to pipeline RISC -V
This project is the complete flow and step by step implementation of RISC-V microarchitecture, in this project we are starting from a simple single cycle implementation and the step towards the pipelined implementation.

# TOOLS AND LANGUAGES USED
-> Vivado\
-> Venus\
-> Systems verilog\
-> RISC-V Assembly

# Architecture Followed
Micro_architecture followed from the book "Digital Designs and Computer Architecture" by Sarah Harris. 

# RISC-V instruction set
This is the instruction set that was followed and architecture was designed for this.

# Directory flow in which the code is uploaded
1: Single_cycle\
2: pipelined only with register\
3: pipelinded with hazards detection, forwarding , stalling and control logic
